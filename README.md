# United-Remote Coding Challenge Application

## Stack and Tooling
### General
* TypeScript
* Monorepo architecture with Yarn Workspace

## Client
* React, with hooks
* react-fetcher-hooks  
A set of react hooks I made for handling data fetching with visual feedback
and error handling.

## Backend
* Backend Framework: NestJS  
Personal preference over ExpressJS: it has a first-class support for TypeScript
and makes the backend code easier to scale. It also makes it easier to apply
good practices (inversion of control, single responssibility pattern, decoupled modules, etc)
* ORM framework: TypeORM
